# 💧 Water Potability Analysis – Team ECONOVA

## 🏆 Hackathon Project

This project was developed as part of **Sreejan**, a hackathon conducted at **Techno India University** by **Sustainovate**, the *Official Sustainability and Innovation Club of Techno India University*, focused on solving real-world sustainability and public health challenges using **AI & data-driven approaches**. The solution secured **2nd place**, recognizing its impact, innovation, and practical applicability.

## 🌍 Project Overview

**Predicting Water Potability** aims to assess whether river water is safe for drinking by leveraging **machine learning** and **real-world water quality parameters**.

The system:

* Predicts **potability (safe / unsafe)**
* Generates a **water quality score (%)**
* Helps authorities, laboratories, NGOs, and communities take **early preventive action**

This project focuses especially on **Indian rivers**, many of which are severely affected by pollution.

---

## 🚨 Background & Motivation

* 🧑‍⚕️ **Massive Health Burden**: Millions are affected annually by water‑borne diseases in India.
* 🏭 **Widespread Contamination**: Over 600 rivers show alarming pollution levels despite national efforts.
* ⚠️ **Urgent Need for Action**: Early prediction enables faster intervention before conditions worsen.

---

## 📚 Literature Insight

Indian rivers—once symbols of purity—are now burdened by:

* Industrial waste
* Sewage discharge
* Chemical contamination

The pollution crisis impacts:

* Public health
* Livelihoods of riverbank communities
* Food chains and ecosystems

Predictive analysis empowers **citizens and authorities** to act proactively.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* ✅ Develop an **AI-based model** to predict river water quality and potability
* ✅ Use **real water-quality parameters** with feature engineering
* ✅ Provide a **fast, accessible, and reliable tool** for early warning and decision-making

---

## 🔍 Need & Scope of the Study

### 🔹 Need

* Rising river pollution 🚯
* Increased water‑borne diseases 🦠
* Data‑driven support for governments & NGOs 🏛️

### 🔹 Scope

* ML‑driven potability prediction
* Analysis across major Indian river basins
* Parameters such as **pH, turbidity, chemical properties**, etc.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

* 📊 **CatBoost Regressor** for water quality score prediction (low RMSE)
* 🔎 **CatBoost Classifier** for potability prediction (binary classification)
* ⚙️ Feature engineering on real‑world water testing data
* 🌐 **FastAPI backend** serving predictions via REST API

The API accepts a **river name** and returns:

* Water quality score
* Potability probability
